# Part Two - Resolving a Customer Issue

### Reply to Alice

Hi Alice,

Thank you for reaching out.

Upon reviewing the domain `site.recruitment.shq.nz`, I noticed that the DNS A record is currently set to a local network private IP address (`192.168.1.10`), which is not accessible publicly. I’ve also pinged your server’s public IP address (`120.138.30.179`), and it is responding well.

**Solution:**

Please ask your Domain/DNS Administrator to update the DNS A record for site.recruitment.shq.nz from `192.168.1.10` to `120.138.30.179`. This change should resolve the accessibility issue and allow the site to function correctly.

If the issue persists after making this update, please feel free to get back to me for further assistance.

Kind regards,
Vinith Samuel
